<p align="center">
A Food Delivery System Architecture Design
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jainam240101/Zomato-Clone/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report Bug</a> • <a href="https://github.com/jainam240101/Zomato-Clone/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Request Feature</a>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>The project is an attempt at making a system design for a food delivery application called Zomato (popular in India). It is a microservice architecture that ties together services like drivers, orders and restaurants. A thoughtful emphasis has been given to architectural aspects like scaling and concurrency in order to learn those concepts.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Project Scope</h3>
<p>The project was undertaken to put into practice system design concepts that we learnt and spin up a scalable microservice architecture. The project is useful to developers who share interest in software architecture designing. It is merely a learning tool.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Project Challenge(s)</h3>
<p>A food delivery system caters to a lot of end users while tying together several internal services. The challenges were to efficiently connect it all together while also considering scale and concurrency problems which constitute the system design. gRPC was used to communicate between the services like drivers and restaurants by the order service.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Project Features</h3>
<p>
<li>Horizontally scalable microservice architecture.</li>
<li>Uses gRPC to communicate among the services.</li>
<li>Connects to Stripe as a payment gateway service.</li>
<li>Uses Redis' Geospatial feature as a proximity service to track the driver's location.</li>
<li>Uses Go servers to handle concurrency related problems.</li>
